### Oreoluwa Lawal / N01452264:
#### - [Bookings Page](https://falcons-restaurant-angular.herokuapp.com/bookings)
The booking page (Booking.tsx) utilizes an API which stores the date, time, name, email and phonenumber. The booking API contains route to get all bookings and save a booking to the database.
In the react app, I use react-calender to display calender and user can only reserve/book within 2 weeks from the current date, they are not able to click any date outside the 2 weeks period. When a user select a date, we get the bookings from the api and check if a reservation is made for that date and filters out the time slot so only the available timeslot is displayed in the select time slot option.
Then user enters their contact info. Once the a booking is made, a thank you page (Thankyou.tsx) is displayed and the details are sent to the users email.
#### - [Contact Page](https://falcons-restaurant-angular.herokuapp.com/contact)
The contact page (Contact.tsx) utilizes nodemailer in the express app, when a user input their inquiry and details, it accesses the API route and an email is sent to the admin(Oreoluwa) with the users details and inquiry, while a followup email is sent to the user informing them that their inquiry has been received.
#### - [Subscription & Newsletter Page](https://falcons-restaurant-angular.herokuapp.com/subscribe)
The subscription page (Subscribe.tsx) utilizes an API which stores subscribers firstname and email to our database. The newsletter API contains route to save a subscriber to the database. The express app uses nodemailer to send an email to the user.
In the react app when user enters their name and email and clicks subscribe, it accesses the API route and saves the information, if successful an email is sent welcoming the user.

#### - [Admin Panel](https://falcons-restaurant-angular.herokuapp.com/admin-menu)
Route protected. User cannot see the admin panel if the account's type is not admin. When creating a new food, if user uses the food id that already exists then new food id will be generated by itself automatically. Admin can search by customer name in the order history page. The admin panel has 2 pages which are editing menu and displaying all orders.

### Vishnu Pillai / N01454618:
#### - Used Photoshop to create the Logo and Favicon
#### - Created the API for menu and orders
#### - Deployed the website and server API to Heroku
#### - [Menu Page](https://falcons-restaurant-angular.herokuapp.com/menu)
The menu page utilizes an API which stores a food ID, food name, price, description, category, and image. It has routes to get all food, get food by id, update food, and delete food. In Angular, there is a Menu component and Menu service. The menu service has an interface for the food type and gets the menu data using the API with Angular's HttpClient. It also uses the Cart service to add food to cart.

#### - [Cart](https://falcons-restaurant-angular.herokuapp.com/menu) (It is in the bottom of the menu)
The cart on the website uses a Cart component and Cart service. The cart uses Angular Material for styling the buttons and other features such as the popup that appears on the side (using [Side-Nav](https://material.angular.io/components/sidenav/overview)) and the counter on the cart button (using [Badge](https://material.angular.io/components/badge/overview)). 

The component uses forms with validation and the service uses rxjs to store the cart data. There are methods in the service to add and remove items from the cart.

#### - [Order Page](https://falcons-restaurant-angular.herokuapp.com/orders)
The orders page utilizes an API which stores an email address, name, phone number, cart, total price, and the date. There is an order component and order service. The order service has a GET request to retrieve all orders based on the user's email address (which is stored in local storage). It only works if the user is logged in, otherwise displays a message for them to login. The Order component simply displays a table with the data from the service.
